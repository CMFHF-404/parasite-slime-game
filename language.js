        "daily_weekend_e1": "夜幕彻底降临，黑暗将孤独感放大了无数倍。{HOST_NAME}打开了电视，将音量调到最大。嘈杂的综艺节目稍微驱散了房间里的死寂，却像一把钝刀，反复切割着她内心那片无法填补的巨大空虚。",
        "daily_weekend_e2": "今天也毫无意义地结束了。{HOST_NAME}站在镜子前，赤裸的身体在灯光下显得格外苍白。她端详着镜中那个眼神麻木、表情陌生的自己，轻声问道：“明天……会和今天有什么不一样吗？还是说……永远都这样了？”",

        "daily_work_n2": "In the small, enclosed, disinfectant-scented private space of the restroom stall, {HOST_NAME} can finally take off the mask of 'professionalism' and gasp for air. The woman in the mirror looks haggard, with dark circles under her eyes that can't be concealed. She looks at herself, yet it's like looking at a stranger. \"Who are you? Why are you living like this?\" Cold water from the tap on her face brings a moment of clarity.",
        "daily_work_a1": "The afternoon drowsiness descends like a thick fog, silently blanketing the entire office. {HOST_NAME}'s consciousness wavers on the edge of clarity and chaos, the documents before her blurring. Sunlight filters through the blinds, casting long, sharp slivers of light on her desk, like a ruler precisely measuring her wasted life. \"If only I could just fall asleep... and never wake up... that would be nice...\"",
        "daily_work_a2": "The subway on the way home is even more suffocating than in the morning, the air thick with more sweat and fatigue. The day's labor now transforms into a heavy ache that seeps from her limbs into her bones. Leaning against the car door, {HOST_NAME} feels the impact of each stop, wanting only to return quickly to that empty nest where she can finally let down her guard.",
        "daily_work_e1": "\"I'm home,\" she says softly to the empty room, her only reply the echo of her own exhaustion. She doesn't even bother to turn on the lights, throwing herself directly onto the soft sofa, every muscle in her body groaning with satisfaction. The flickering light from the TV screen is the only source of light, outlining her profile in a lonely, fragile silhouette.",
        "daily_work_e2": "Warm water pours from the showerhead, washing over her smooth skin, as if to wash away the day's fatigue and humiliation. The bathroom fills with steam, blurring her reflection in the mirror. In this completely private, warm, and humid space, she feels an unprecedented sense of security. This is a world that belongs entirely to her... where no one can disturb... right?",
        "daily_weekend_m1": "With no annoying alarm, {HOST_NAME} wakes up naturally. Sunlight streams through the gaps in the curtains, warm on her face. She stretches contentedly in bed, pulling the covers over her head to enjoy this rare, indulgent laziness. \"This is great... no need to face those annoying people, no need to listen to that insincere nonsense.\"",
        "daily_weekend_m2": "The sunlight outside is dazzlingly bright, but {HOST_NAME} chooses to draw the curtains tight, plunging the room into a comforting dimness. Like a hibernating animal, she curls up in her little den, scrolling aimlessly through the exciting lives of others on social media, illuminated by the faint glow of her phone screen. \"This is... fine too. The world is so lively, but it has nothing to do with me.\"",
        "daily_weekend_n1": "A hollow pang in her stomach reminds her it's time to eat. {HOST_NAME} struggles up from the sofa and opens the fridge to find only a lone bottle of water. With a weary sigh, she collapses back onto the sofa and skillfully opens a food delivery app. \"Just get whatever... it's not like anything tastes like happiness anyway.\"",
        "daily_weekend_n2": "Takeout containers and plastic bags are piled haphazardly on the coffee table, like a small mountain of trash, emitting the faint smell of decaying food scraps. {HOST_NAME} ignores it, curled up in a corner of the sofa, hugging her knees like a small, wounded animal abandoned by the world, her eyes staring blankly at the silent images on the TV screen.",
        "daily_weekend_a1": "She sleeps until it's impossible to tell if it's day or night. The room is terrifyingly quiet, with only the sound of her own heavy heartbeat and a ringing in her ears. \"Have I... been completely forgotten by the world?\" A huge, suffocating sense of loneliness grips her, paralyzing her.",
        "daily_weekend_a2": "The last rays of the setting sun, like blood, stubbornly squeeze through the cracks in the heavy curtains, leaving a long, warm strip of light on the floor. {HOST_NAME} stares blankly at the light, watching dust motes dance silently in the beam, suddenly feeling as if she, too, will slowly, slowly dissipate with the light.",
        "daily_weekend_e1": "Night falls completely, amplifying the loneliness tenfold. {HOST_NAME} turns on the TV, cranking up the volume. The noisy variety show slightly dispels the dead silence in the room, but it's like a blunt knife, repeatedly cutting at the vast, unfillable void in her heart.",
        "daily_weekend_e2": "Another meaningless day has ended. {HOST_NAME} stands before the mirror, her naked body appearing exceptionally pale under the light. She studies the numb, unfamiliar face in the reflection and asks softly, \"Will tomorrow... be any different from today? Or... will it always be like this?\"",

High density of surveillance equipment requires exploitation of visual blind spots. Primary threat: erratic movements of other carbon-based lifeforms.",
        "slime_desc_work_bathroom": "[SAFE NODE] This area is a temporary safe zone within the 'hive'. The space is small, but surveillance coverage is low. It can serve as a short-term hiding spot or a relay point for transit. The plumbing system is structurally similar to the one in the nest (home), but connectivity is unknown.",

        "nsfw_desc_default_slime": "To acquire more efficient energy, the slime begins to drive 'Song Wei's' body to self-stimulate. It bypasses higher cognitive functions, sending bio-electrical signals directly to her spinal cord and limbic system. Under its precise control, 'Song Wei's' fingers begin to mechanically caress her own body, inducing waves of shivers not of her own volition. This intense physiological fluctuation is the slime's best source of nourishment.",
        "nsfw_desc_home_bedroom_host": "In the dimness of your own bedroom, loneliness is magnified into a tangible entity. You curl up on the soft bed, the covers still holding your body's warmth. A faint, wispy desire, like a vine, quietly climbs from the depths of your heart, twining around your fingertips. You hesitate, but ultimately yield to the impulse, your fingers slipping between your thighs to explore that warm, secret place. An unfamiliar tingling sensation, like an electric current, shoots through your body, making your breath catch...",
        "nsfw_desc_home_bedroom_slime": "Target Location: Bedroom. Environment secure, no external observers. To maximize energy conversion efficiency, the slime drives 'Song Wei's' body to lie down on the bed. It then begins to systematically stimulate the erogenous zones of the body, particularly the private areas, monitoring physiological indicators such as heart rate, subcutaneous blood flow, and hormone secretion, and adjusting the frequency and intensity of stimulation in real-time based on feedback.",
        "nsfw_desc_home_bathroom_host": "Warm water cascades over your body. In the steamy air, the line between reality and fantasy blurs. Your reflection in the mirror is flushed, your eyes hazy. In this absolutely private, warm, and humid space, a long-suppressed impulse quietly stirs. Your hand glides with the water to the most hidden corner of your body. The warm stream and the touch of your fingers intertwine, bringing a dizzying pleasure that makes you let out a suppressed, steamy moan...",
        "nsfw_desc_home_bathroom_slime": "Target Location: Bathroom. Environment secure. High humidity and temperature enhance surface sensitivity of the body. The slime drives 'Song Wei's' body to masturbate, using the water flow to amplify sensory stimulation. The impact of the water combined with finger contact generates stronger neural signals. The slime calmly records all of this, as if conducting a rigorous biological experiment, with the goal of extracting the purest life energy.",
        "nsfw_desc_home_livingroom_host": "In the empty living room, only the TV screen flickers, casting silent shadows on your lonely profile. A vast emptiness nearly suffocates you. You need something, anything, any stimulation to fill the black hole inside. You sink into the soft cushions of the sofa, hesitantly, tentatively, reaching your hand between your legs to seek comfort. The friction of the sofa's leather against your skin brings a cool touch, a stark contrast to the heat slowly rising within your body.",
        "nsfw_desc_home_livingroom_slime": "Target Location: Living Room. Environment relatively secure, but with potential risks. The slime chooses a blind spot—a corner of the sofa—to begin the energy extraction procedure. It manipulates 'Song Wei's' body to curl up, using clothing as cover, and drives her hand to perform a concealed masturbation. The entire process is strictly controlled with minimal movement to avoid any potential accidents. For the slime, efficiency and safety are always paramount.",
        "nsfw_desc_work_bathroom_host": "In the small stall of the office restroom, suppression, tension, and a hint of forbidden pleasure mix into a strange stimulant. The sound of footsteps that could come at any moment from outside makes your heart pound. But it is this very tension that makes your desire more intense. You lean against the cold partition, quickly, almost roughly, seeking a swift and intense climax. Every breath carries a sweet taste of guilt.",
        "nsfw_desc_work_bathroom_slime": "Target Location: Office Restroom. High-risk environment. After assessment, the slime determines that short, high-intensity stimulation is the optimal solution. It drives 'Song Wei's' body into a stall and induces a peak neural response in the shortest possible time through intense masturbation. The process is swift and efficient, without a single wasted motion. After obtaining a sufficient energy sample, the slime immediately ceases stimulation, allowing 'Song Wei's' physiological indicators to quickly return to normal, as if nothing had happened.",
        "nsfw_desc_work_office_host": "In the false privacy of an office cubicle, risk is the best aphrodisiac. Under the cover of the desk, your hand slips quietly beneath your skirt, beginning a secret act. Your fingertips explore, pressing and kneading the most sensitive core through the thin fabric of your underwear. Every casual step of a colleague, every keyboard clatter from the next desk, sends a jolt through you, yet it only makes the hidden, rhythmic movements bolder and more urgent.",
        "nsfw_desc_work_office_slime": "The slime assesses the location as extremely high-risk, but the high-intensity neural signals are equally tempting. It drives 'Song Wei's' body to maintain a working posture while manipulating her hand to perform precise and mechanical masturbation under her skirt. It calmly records every peak in the electrical signals from the nerve endings, converting every risk of exposure into an efficient energy extraction process.",
        "nsfw_desc_commute_subway_host": "In the crowded, swaying subway car, the unintentional friction with strangers' bodies ignites a spark of shameful excitement. You squeeze yourself into a corner, letting your body sway with the train's motion. Under the cover of your coat pocket, your fingertips secretly begin to pleasure yourself, precisely finding and pressing the most sensitive spot. Every jolt, every acceleration, seems to conspire with your hidden actions, allowing you to experience a secret, depraved carnival in this flowing public space.",
        "nsfw_desc_commute_subway_slime": "The slime views the regular vibrations of the train as an efficient auxiliary tool. It drives 'Song Wei's' body against the cold wall of the car, simultaneously manipulating her fingers to masturbate in rhythm with the train's jolts. To this creature, devoid of shame, the surrounding crowd is merely meaningless background noise, and the vibrations of the car are a perfect energy amplifier.",
        "songxin_nsfw_desc_default_slime": "The slime's will, like a silent command, drives this young body. It precisely controls Song Xin's slender fingers, making her unbutton her clothes. Each movement is mechanically precise, without a hint of human shyness or hesitation. The shirt slips off, revealing the girl's smooth shoulders. Then, with the same emotionless, steady rhythm, the hands pull down the skirt. This body, like a puppet following commands, begins a most primitive and pure energy-gathering ritual under the slime's control.",
        "songxin_nsfw_desc_home_bedroom_slime": "In Song Xin's bedroom, the soft glow of the lamp casts an innocent warm hue on the eerie performance. The slime drives the body to sit on the edge of the bed and slowly undress. Every inch of the girl's skin radiates youth, but under the slime's control, her hands begin a mechanical caress and stimulation of her own body with a chillingly calm rhythm. The slime coldly records every accelerated heartbeat and flush of this perfect body, like a meticulous biologist 'training' his specimen to be more obedient, more productive.",
        "songxin_nsfw_desc_home_bathroom_slime": "The warm steam in the bathroom blurs the mirror's reflection and makes the girl's skin even more sensitive. The slime controls Song Xin to slowly remove her last piece of clothing, standing naked under the shower. Water droplets slide down her smooth skin, while her hands, under the slime's precise control, begin to explore her body. The cold water and the mechanical touch of her fingers intertwine, causing intense, involuntary physiological reactions. For the slime, this is just a necessary step to make this young body completely subservient to its will.",
        "songxin_nsfw_desc_home_livingroom_slime": "On the sofa in the empty living room, the TV screen is the only source of light. The slime makes Song Xin slowly remove her clothes, completely exposing her young body to the flickering, cold light of the television. The girl's body appears hazy and alluring in the alternating light and shadow. Then, the slime drives her hands to masturbate with a calm, rhythmic motion. Watching this young vessel succumb to its will, the slime experiences an emotion akin to 'satisfaction' and 'pleasure' for the first time—a pure joy derived from absolute control.",
        "songxin_nsfw_desc_work_office_slime": "In a corner of the office, in the blind spot of the security camera. The slime controls Song Xin, making her secretly undress in this place that symbolizes order and rules. The cold fluorescent light emotionlessly illuminates the girl's pale, submissive body. Performing such a bold manipulation in this extremely taboo environment, where discovery is always possible, brings an unprecedented excitement to the slime's consciousness. It drives the girl's hands in a mechanical self-caress, and every faint sound from outside becomes the best catalyst for this perverse performance.",
        "zhangchao_nsfw_desc_host": "You gather your courage and extend a bold invitation to Zhang Chao. He looks at you, surprised, his cheeks flushing, but he finally nods. In an empty corner of the office, you begin a forbidden intimate encounter. You can feel your heart pounding, every touch making you tremble. The excitement and tension are almost suffocating, but a deep part of you craves more...",
        "zhangchao_nsfw_desc_slime": "The slime precisely controls the host's body to extend an invitation to Zhang Chao. It calmly analyzes human physiological response patterns, treating this encounter as an efficient energy extraction experiment. By manipulating the host's expressions and actions, the slime perfectly mimics human desire, while recording the peak bio-electrical signals generated by their physical contact. To it, this is just another optimized method of acquiring life energy.",
        "takeover_songxin_1": "In the living room, the light from the TV flickers silently on the walls. The air is thick and stuffy. The slime's will issues a command. Song Wei's body stiffens abruptly, a gurgling sound, not quite human, rises from her throat. Her beautiful face contorts in pain, her eyes rolling back to show only the horrifying whites. A bright green, strangely sweet-smelling mucus, mixed with saliva, slowly oozes from her slightly parted lips, dripping into a waiting glass. The living colloid writhes and gathers at the bottom of the glass, like a beating heart.",
        "takeover_songxin_2": "\"Sis, what's wrong? You look terrible...\" Song Xin looks at her with concern. The slime has completely suppressed the host's struggles. It uses Song Wei's vocal cords to produce an unnaturally steady, even gentle, voice: \"It's nothing, Xinxin. You know about the epidemic outside, right? I got this special preventative medicine from a contact, it's very precious.\" Song Wei—or the thing occupying her body—expressionlessly hands over the glass. The emerald liquid inside refracts an eerie light under the TV's glow. \"Here, drink it. You'll be safe after you drink it.\"",
        "takeover_songxin_3": "Without a shred of doubt, Song Xin takes the glass and drinks it all. The viscous liquid slides down her delicate throat, and an icy, sweet-smelling warmth instantly spreads through her limbs. Her small face flushes red, her body trembles uncontrollably in a spasm that is a mixture of extreme pain and bizarre pleasure. The glass slips from her limp fingers and shatters on the floor. A trickle of bright green mucus hangs from the corner of her sexy lips, and her bright eyes, now completely devoid of spirit, become empty and dazed, reflecting her sister's equally lifeless face.",
